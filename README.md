# CodeCrackerGame
A terminal-based Code Guessing game implemented in Python.

### Gameplay
User specifies difficulty which determines length of code. User takes upto 10 attempts guessing the code. After each attempt, clues are giving about the code - specifically, which digits are part of the final code and which digits are already in their correct positions. Game ends when User guesses the right code or runs out of attempts.

### Note
If your terminal supports emojis, you may uncomment lines 8 and 9 of the code to have emoji based output which may be more appealing.
